 * TODO:
 * Write some JavaScript that uses a `confirm` dialog to ask the user if they
 * would like to enter a number. If they click 'Ok', prompt the user for a
 * number, then use 3 separate alerts to tell the user:
 *
 * - whether the number is even or odd
 * - what the number plus 100 is
 * - if the number is negative or positive
 *
 * if what the user enters is not a number, use an alert to tell them that, and
 * do *not* display any of the above information.
 *
 * Can you refactor your code to use functions?
 * HINT: The way we prompt for a value could be improved
